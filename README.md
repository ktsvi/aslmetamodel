# aslmetamodel
This eclipse project represents an experimentation of a research work related to an approach of spatially explicit agent-based modelling. 
A metamodel called ASL is propose to generate a base code of spatially explicit agent model for sinumation. 
A generator engine called ABMGenerator is also produced with Xpand (in eclipse) as a support for modelling with GAMA platform.
